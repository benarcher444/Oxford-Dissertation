# Oxford-Dissertation
A repository for the code used in my Oxford Dissertation.

The NEAT_training.py file will run the neat algorithm and train new swimmers.

The compare_swimmers.py file visualises new swimmers and will compile them for future quick use.

The compare_compiled_swimmers.py file compares previously compiled swimmers and can run much quicker.

Trained and Compiled swimmers will be saved in their respective folders.

More info for each of the program can be found at the top of each of the programs' code.
